f of some x means:
    Add up x and one
    # "result" is a variable that is always
    # the result of the last expression.
    # expressions like "print" return their
    # input value.
    Multiply the result by 3
    Subtract the result from two

g of some x means:

    # you can use functions in other functions,
    # even if they are defined later (example here: negative x)
    Multiply negative x by three
    Subtract one from the result

negative some number means:
    Subtract the number from zero

minus some number means:
    Subtract the number from zero

print out f of two
print out f of three
print out f of four


print out g of two
print out g of three
print out g of four

# statements in single or double quotes 
# will not be evaluated

print 'g of five' to the console
print "g of six"

# to print single or double quotes, surround them 
# with the other quote type

print '"'
print "'"


# you can compare objects
compare some a and some b means:
    if a is less than b:
        print "a is less than b"
    else:
        print "a is not less than b"

compare one and 2
compare 5 and three
